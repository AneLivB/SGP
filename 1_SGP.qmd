This file contains the R code used for the manuscript "*Sustainability in the laboratory: evaluating the reuseability of microtiter plates for PCR and fragment detection*" by Ane Liv Berthelsen, Anneke J. Paijmans, Jaume Forcada and Joseph I. Hoffman. The data files can be downloaded via Zenodo, **link** and additional scripts are available on Github, **link**.

# Aims

We set out to explore the reuseability of 96-microtiter plates with the aim to test the following hypothesis: (i) reusing microtiter plates should be feasible, in at least some circumstances, without significantly compromising data quality; however (ii) the high sensitivity of PCR to trace amounts of DNA might introduce a risk of cross-contamination when reusing PCR plates, potentially increasing the genotyping error rate. Conversely, (iii) we anticipated that reusing detection plates would likely have a minimal impact on the genotyping error rate, as the capillary sequencer measures all signals, but only the strongest signals are scored.

# Materials and Methods

We designed an experimental setup to assess the re-usability of 96-micro well plates within the context of microsatellite genotyping. The setup contained 4 treatments: standard procedure, internal control, re-used PCR plate and re-used detection plate (See @fig-Schematic). Each Antarctic fur seal tissue sample was extracted using an adapted chloroform-isoamylalcohol protocol and genotyped following our standard protocol as detailed in Paijmans et al. 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-62290-x).

![Schematic overview](Results/Figures/SGPsetupfinal.png){#fig-Schematic fig-align="center"}

The first (standard protocol) and the second (internal control) treatment group followed the standard protocol. Afterward, the plates from the standard protocol were cleaned. The cleaned PCR and detection plates were reassigned to treatment groups three and four respectively. We retained information about the samples that were originally processed on each plate and ensured that no plate was reused for the same samples originally processed on it. The genotyping error rate for each treatment was calculated by comparing the scored genotype to the corresponding genotype in the standard protocol treatment.

## Data

The data for this project are the raw sequencing reads from the ABI 3730xl capillary sequencer. Each files is identified with the following name structure: RackX_mixY_Z. Where X gives the rack number, Y the mix and Z the treatment (1 = standard procedure, 2 = internal control, 3 = Re-used detection plate and 4 = Re-used PCR plate). The 0_Raw_data_processing.qmd script processes this data into .csv files containing the scored allele information for each DNA plate for all mixes, which is loaded in here.

```

### Prepare the datasets

For each sample we noted whether the genotype matched with the 'standard procedure' per loci and for all treatments whether the genotype was scored or not. This yielded two variables referred to as 'mismatch' and 'missing' respectively. The binary mismatch variable (0 = match, 1 = mismatch) was used as the outcome variable for the model.

```{r}
#| label: Mismatch_loci
#| echo: TRUE
# #The dataset created from this function is called 'Analysis.data' 
# #Analysis.data is the dataset used for the model. 
# #The dataset can be loaded directly, so it's not necessary to run this function.

To calculate the single-locus genotype error rates, the following function was used to identify and count both mismatched alleles and mismatched single-locus genotypes. It creates the dataset Mismatches.csv, which is later used to calculate per treatment single-genotype error rates.

## Model

We ran a Bayesian logistic regression mixed model with treatment included as a three level categorical variable to explore the effect on mismatched genotypes data. The 'internal control' treatment was set as the reference category and thereby includes the intercept. Sample ID, DNA plate, multiplexes and loci variables were included as random effects in the model.

```{r}
#| label: Bayes_model1
#| echo: FALSE
# #Improve speed of bayes model
# #we recommend running this is a fresh R session or restarting your current session
# remotes::install_github("stan-dev/cmdstanr")
# install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
# install.packages("remotes")
```

```{r}
#| label: Bayes_model_mismatch
#| echo: TRUE
# #The model takes about 24h to run; model output has been saved as model.mismatch.2.Rdata

# load the data
# Analysis.data <- read.csv(file.path(working_dir, "Analysis.data.csv"))

#A Bernoulli trial is a random experiment that has two possible outcomes: success or failure.

#thin: adjust thinning so you have at least 1000 samples per chain
#(check: (iter-warmup)/thin)
#max_treedepth default = 10 (do not increase beyond 12)
# set.seed(1995)
# model.mismatch <- brms::brm(Mismatch ~ Treatment + (1|ID) + (1|Rack) + (1|Loci) + (1|Mix),
#              data = Analysis.data,
#              family = bernoulli,
#              cores = 3,
#              iter = 100000,
#              thin = 70,
#              warmup = 30000, #standard is 20-50% of iter
#              chains = 3,
#              control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99, max_treedepth = 11),
#              backend = "cmdstanr", #improve speed
#              silent = 0) #to see progress
# 
# save(model.mismatch, file = "Data/Working_data/Processed_data/model.mismatch.2.Rdata")
```

### Model diagnostics
In the following, we explore the model diagnostics from the brms package. 
Plot is used to visually investigate the chains and posterior distributions and pp_check (posterior predictive checking) is used to compare the observed outcome variable to a simulated dataset from the posterior predictive distribution. 
```{r}
#| label: Bayes_model_diagnostics
#| echo: TRUE
#| warning: FALSE
#Load the model information to perform model diagnostics
load(file="Data/Working_data/Processed_data/model.mismatch.2.Rdata")

#Check model 
plot(model.mismatch)

#Further tests
mcmc_plot(model.mismatch, type = "acf") #autocorrelation is close to 0
mcmc_plot(model.mismatch, type = "pairs")
pp_check(model.mismatch, type = "bars", ndraws = 1000)
```

#### Rhat

Rhat statistics are used to diagnose sampling behaviour and should be close to 1. Rhat values above 1 means the models has not yet converged. 

```{r}
#| label: Bayes_model_rhat
#| echo: TRUE
#rhat
mcmc_rhat(brms::rhat(model.mismatch))
```

### Model summary
The model summary provides general information about the model, group and population level effects. In addition, it provides information on how well the model could estimate the posterior distribution. ESS-bulk and ESS_tail values should be close to 3000 (the total post-warmup draws). 
```{r}
#| label: Bayes_model_output
#| echo: TRUE
#Check model output
summary(model.mismatch)
```

# Results

281 samples were included in the analysis. On rack 154 the two samples from 2007-2008 were excluded, due to lack of DNA for the last treatment. Likewise for two of the positive controls on R156.

Per-reaction genotyping error rates for the internal control, reused detection plate and reused PCR plate treatment groups, calculated relative to the standard protocol treatment group.

### Posterior beta estimates

Posterior distributions of the beta coefficients of the internal control (blue), reused detection plate (orange) and reused PCR plate (red) treatment groups on genotyping errors. 50% and 90% confidence intervals are represented with thick and thin black lines respectively.
